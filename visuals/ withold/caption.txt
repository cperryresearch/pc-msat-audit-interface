Figure X. PC-MSAT Withhold Visual — State-Segmented Motion Trace

Dataset and rendering context.
Single real trajectory rendered under the fixed PC-MSAT renderer input contract, using the same preprocessing, sampling cadence, and state-segmentation rules as the canonical Proceed visual.

What is shown.
The upper panel shows the state-segmented motion trace.
The lower panel shows the corresponding raw curvature signal aligned in time.
No additional geometric or kinematic signals are included.

Audit outcome.
No contiguous segment of the trajectory satisfies the conservative geometric and persistence criteria required for a PC-MSAT Proceed audit result.
All segments are withheld due to insufficient geometric support.

Scope and limits.
This visual discloses motion structure only.
It does not assert physical cause, behavioral explanation, prediction, or correctness of any downstream interpretation.

Interface framing.
PC-MSAT functions as a disclosure-oriented audit interface.
A Withhold result indicates insufficient geometric support under fixed criteria, not failure, error, or absence of motion.
